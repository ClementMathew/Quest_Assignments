### What is an .sln project file ?

<br>

- An ".sln" file in Visual Studio is a solution file. ".sln" is a structure for organizing projects in Visual Studio.

- It contains the state information for projects in ".sln" (text-based, shared) and ".suo" (binary, user-specific solution options) files.

- We can add multiple projects inside one solution. It is a key file that contains the structure of the entire solution, which can consist of one or more projects.

- The ".sln" file is a plain-text file with a specific structure, so it can be edited manually if needed.

#### Usage :

When you open a solution in Visual Studio, the IDE uses the ".sln" file to load all projects and settings related to that solution.

### What is .cs project file ?

---

<br>

- Basically the ".cs" project file contains the list of files in your project, plus the references to system assemblies etc.

- " .csproj " is a Visual Studio .NET C# Project file extension. This file will have information about the files included in that project, assemblies used in that project, project GUID and project version etc.

- This file is related to your project. The ".csproj" file specifies the files, resources, and dependencies that are part of the C# project.

- It holds information like version numbers, assembly information, compilation options, and platform settings (e.g., Debug or Release).

### What is bin and obj folder ?

---

<br>

- The obj folder holds object, or intermediate, files, which are compiled binary files that haven't been linked yet.

- They're essentially fragments that will be combined to produce the final executable. The compiler generates one object file for each source file, and those files are placed into the obj folder.

- The bin folder holds binary files, which are the actual executable code for your application or library.

- Each of these folders are further subdivided into Debug and Release folders, which simply correspond to the project's build configurations.

- The two types of files discussed above are placed into the appropriate folder, depending on which type of build you perform.

- This makes it easy for you to determine which executables are built with debugging symbols, and which were built with optimizations enabled and ready for release.

<br>

### What is the usage of Debug and Release ?

---

<br>

- The Debug and Release folders in the bin directory are where Visual Studio places the compiled output of your project.

- The Debug folder contains the build for debugging purposes, with additional information (like .pdb files) to help developers debug the code. This build is slower and larger but easier to troubleshoot.

- The Release folder contains the optimized build for production, without the extra debugging information, making it faster and more compact for deployment.

<br>

### Define .exe and .pdb file.

---

<br>

- The ".exe" is the compiled executable file that runs your application.

- The ".pdb" is a debugging file that helps map the executable back to the source code for debugging purposes.

- It is the executable file that runs your program.

- When you compile a C# project (like a console or Windows Forms application), the C# code is compiled into Intermediate Language (IL), which is then packaged into an .exe file.

- You can double-click this .exe file to run your application independently without needing Visual Studio.

- The .pdb file contains debugging information for your application, such as the mapping between the IL code and your original C# source code.

- It helps debuggers (like Visual Studio) to provide a meaningful debugging experience by showing the actual source code lines.

- It is essential for debugging, but not needed when running the application in production. Without a .pdb file, debugging is harder because the debugger cannot map the running code back to the original source code effectively.
